# Sparkify Data Warehouse

Sparkify is a music streaming startup that needs help transitioning their fast-growing data to the cloud. The data is stored in S3, which is a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app. There is also a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app.

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3 into Redhsift and transforms the data into dimensional tables for further analysis for the team to explore.

Datasets:
* Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
* Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
